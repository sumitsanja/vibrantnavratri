                <h2>Significance of Navratri</h2>
                <p>Nine forms of Mother Shakti - the female form of power is worshipped during Navratri - Durga,
                    Bhadrakali, Jagadamba, Annapurna, Sarvamangala, Bhairavi, Chandika, Lalita, Bhavani and Mookambika.
                    The forms worshipped differ from region to region.

                <p>Lord Rama worshipped Goddess Durga in nine aspects, for nine days, in order to gather the strength
                    and power to kill Ravana.

                    The festival also symbolizes the nine day long fight between Lord Rama and Ravana. On the tenth day,
                    Lord Rama killed Ravana, which came to be known as Vijay Dashmi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nine nights known as Navratri, symbolize the nine days of battle between Devi Durga and
                    Mahisasura, while the tenth day, which is Vijayadashami-literally means the victorious tenth day of
                    conquest of good over evil.


                    The next three days, the Mother is adored as a giver of spiritual wealth, Lakshmi who is considered
                    to have the power of bestowing on her devotees the inexhaustible wealth with joy.

                    The final set of three days is spent in worshipping the mother as the goddess of wisdom Saraswati in
                    order has all-round success in life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Navratri is observed twice a year, once in the beginning of summer and gain on the onset of winter.

                    Ancient sages linked this period of worship to thank the divine powers that provides energy for the
                    earth to move around the sun, causing the changes in the outer nature and maintaining the accurate
                    balance of the universe.

                    Maa Durga has eighteen arms which signify that she possesses combined power of nine incarnations of
                    Lord Vishnu on earth.</p>
